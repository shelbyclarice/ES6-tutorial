// Notes from Lessons

// Const, Let, and Bar

// Using const or let instead of var (variable) for ES6
var color = 'red';
color;

// Const (Constant)= used to declare variables where we expect the value tha we are assigning to it to never change
// Let = used to declare variables when we expect the value of the variable to change over time

var name = 'Jane';
var title = 'Software Engineer';
var hourlyWage = 40;

// ES6 (ask ourselves do I ever expect these values to need to be changed?)

// Expect to not have to change there name, but would expect title and hourlyWage to change
const name = 'Jane';
let title = 'Software Engineer';
let hourlyWage = 40;

// some time later...

// Don't need to use let again
title = 'Senior Software Engineer';
hourlyWage = 45;
